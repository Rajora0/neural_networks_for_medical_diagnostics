# The Revolution of Artificial Intelligence in Diagnostic Medicine

## Introduction

Globalization and the continuous advancements in digital technologies have profoundly reshaped various sectors of the industry, and the healthcare domain is no exception. This article explores the significant impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), in the classification of medical images. The ability of ANNs to learn, model, and solve complex problems has played a crucial role in the analysis of medical images.

## The Role of Neural Networks in Diagnostic Medicine

Neural Networks have shown promise in the classification of medical images, providing doctors with a valuable tool to detect and diagnose diseases more quickly and accurately. Their ability to learn patterns and features from images enables efficient identification of pathologies, surpassing manual analysis methods.

The importance of image classification in medical diagnosis cannot be underestimated, given the complexity of the task that requires substantial knowledge and experience. Medical images, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), and X-rays, play a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment planning. The use of Neural Networks in image classification not only enhances the accuracy of diagnoses but also significantly speeds up the results acquisition process.

## The Proposed Problem
